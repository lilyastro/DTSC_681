        I currently work at a digital marketing agency as a Data Engineer. Upon my graduation, I am transitioning into a Machine
        Learning Engineering role on our AI/ML team. 

        In my free time, I like to go on hikes (although hikes in Columbus, OH are scarce), hang out with friends, and cook.
        I started doing Lagree (a form of Pilates) about 6 months ago and love it - I go about 3-4 times a week.
